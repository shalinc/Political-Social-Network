# Creating a Political Social Network of Presidential Election 2016 Candidates using Twitter.

### Used Twitter handle of the following US presidential candidates:
<ul>
  <li>DrJillStein</li>
  <li>GovGaryJohnson</li>
  <li>HillaryClinton</li>
  <li>realDonaldTrump</li>
</ul>


These handles are written into a file named "candidates.txt"

We have used "Twitter API" to construct a graph like Network for these accounts and then using "networkx" library we plot the links for the graph.

#### Follow these steps and add your credentials

1. You need to create an account on twitter.com
2. Generate authentication tokens.
3. Add your tokens to the key/token variables below. (API Key == Consumer Key)


#### Instructions to copy the environment to run the program without any dependency issue.

I have made a conda environment for this program named "politicalsocialnetwork.yml"

For running all the code without any errors it is better to activate the environment in which they have been written and executed.

To activate the environment: <b>"conda env create -f politicalsocialnetwork.yml" "source activate politicalsocialnetwork"</b>

Now you are in politicalsocialnetwork environment and can easily run all the files in this repository without any issues.
