# Creating a Political Social Network of Presidential Election 2016 Candidates using Twitter.

### Used Twitter handle of the following US presidential candidates:
<ul>
  <li>DrJillStein</li>
  <li>GovGaryJohnson</li>
  <li>HillaryClinton</li>
  <li>realDonaldTrump</li>
</ul>


These handles are written into a file named "candidates.txt"

We have used "Twitter API" to construct a graph like Network for these accounts and then using "networkx" library we plot the links for the graph.

#### Follow these steps and add your credentials

1. You need to create an account on twitter.com
2. Generate authentication tokens.
3. Add your tokens to the key/token variables below. (API Key == Consumer Key)
